  text: 'I am not a big lover of Shakespeares plays but Macbeth is a story few have not heard at one time or another this movie is a great watch for those who enjoy the story and those who are new to it Fassbender gives an amazing performance as Macbeth and speaks the famous words in a way not heard before a modern day retelling of an old story done right.',
